## Beware of the fake Antivirus Extensions

Though Chrome regularly checks for fake and malicious extensions, there are few developers that bluff users by creating the web extensions with the modified name of legit antivirus programs such as **Antivirus Totall Protection**. There is clearly a spelling mistake in their name, and they lure users by banking on the keyword. You must be aware of such fake web extensions because they might be malicious, and instead of safeguarding your Chrome browser, it would do the opposite.
