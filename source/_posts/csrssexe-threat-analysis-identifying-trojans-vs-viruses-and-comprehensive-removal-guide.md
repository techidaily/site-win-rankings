## CSRSS.exe Threat Analysis: Identifying Trojans Vs. Viruses & Comprehensive Removal Guide

However, since it is a common and critical system process, many cyber attackers take advantage of it and release the malicious [Trojan](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) program sneaking in the CSRSS.exe name.

## What are the symptoms of the CSRSS.exe attack?

The fake CSRSS.exe might be hiding anywhere in the system and sneakingly spying on users or conducting other illicit activities. Since it disguises itself in the name of a legitimate and safe process, it is pretty challenging to detect the CSRSS.exe trojan. However, the system shows some common symptoms that might confirm the presence of Trojan malware. Here is the list of those indications:

* CPU usage suddenly rises than usual.
* The system lags frequently.
* Your browser is bombarded with malicious pop-ups.
* A random window is opened without the user’s initiation.
* Redirection to untrustworthy or suspicious sites.

## How does CSRR.exe enter my system?

There are various mediums the fake CSRR.exe might have entered your system. Here are some top ways:

* You might have downloaded the software that contains the virus and get an entry on your device after you install that software. It also comes with the bundled software.
* Cybercriminals might have sent an [infected email](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/), which you might have opened, and the virus gets installed silently on your computer.
* You might have seen an intriguing pop-up ad on a website and clicked it, making way for the IDP.Generic Virus on your device.
* Once a trojan program gets an entry, it initiates the chain reaction and automatically installs other malicious programs.
* Peer-to-peer networks, such as torrents, are also one of the primary carriers of such viruses.

## How do CSRSS.exe works?

The CSRSS.exe works similarly to any other Trojan program. It pretends to be a legitimate program, hides itself in the system, and conducts various malicious activities like stealing user’s bank information, passwords, spying on their mails, and more. The CSRSS.exe trojan might often install itself by copying its executable to the Windows or Windows system folders and then modifying the registry to run this file at each system start. CSRSS.exe will often alter the following subkey in order to accomplish this:

**HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run**

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

## How to verify the presence of a fake CSRSS.exe File?

If you have spotted a CSRSS.exe file, there are two simple and straight ways to confirm whether it is legit or fake. The first is the location of the file. The original, legitimate CSRSS.exe executable file is located in the **_C:\\Windows\\System32_** folder. Any file named CSRSS.exe, which is located in any other folder than this, is undoubtedly a malware or fake file.

The second way is through Task Manager. Follow these steps:

1. Launch Task Manager.
2. Under the Process tab, look for **CSRSS.exe** or **Client Server Runtime Subsystem** process.
3. Right-click on the file and click on **Delete.**
4. If Windows prompts you with a warning box, then it is a legit CSRSS.exe process. If Windows does not show any warning box, then the CSRSS.exe process is fake.

## How to remove CSRSS.exe Trojan from the system?

After spotting the CSRSS.exe, you can delete it; however, this won’t completely remove it from the system as it might have infected registries and more files of the system. There are several methods to remove it from the device entirely. 

**Note:** Delete the CSRSS.exe only if you are sure that it is malicious. Deleting the original CSRSS.exe could create complications in the system and result in BSOD.

### **Remove CSRSS.exe through Registry Editor**

Sine CSRSS.exe Trojan modifies the registry to install itself; you have to remove it from the Registry through Regedit. Here are the steps for that:

1. Launch Run command box and type **regedit** to open Registry Editor. ![Open Registry Editor Run Command](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Open-Registry-Editor-Run-Command.jpg)
2. Before modifying or deleting anything, it is sensible to back up the registries. Click on **File** and select Export, and save the registries on any safe place on the hard drive or external drive.![export registries](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/export-registries.png)
3. After creating a backup, click on **Edit** and select **Find**. ![find in registry](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/find-in-registry.png)

### **Restart your PC in Safe Mode**

Windows Safe Mode is the perfect environment to find out and solve the critical errors in the system. In safe mode, only system programs and some crucial programs run. Safe mode would most likely kill the applications and its files that try to run automatically on your system.

Here are the steps to eliminate thre temporary files:

1. Open the Run command window.
2. Type **%temp%** and hit the enter key.![temp run command](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/temp-run-command.png)
3. This run command would navigate you to this path: **_C:\\Users\\\[username\]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp,_** that is, the temp folder.
