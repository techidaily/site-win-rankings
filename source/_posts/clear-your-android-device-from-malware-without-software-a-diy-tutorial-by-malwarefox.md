These viruses can come from a number of sources, including malicious websites, downloads from third-party app stores, and even through infected USB drives or SD cards.

4. Remember to make a list of apps that you are removing, so that if they are safe, you can reinstall them later

5. After each removal, restart your device in normal mode and see if the problem is fixed or not. Until the malicious apps are caught, repeat the above step.
6. Once the malicious application is found, you can reinstall the other applications that you have removed.

## Tips to Safeguard Devices from Malware

Protecting your device from malware is better than curing it after the infection. We have listed out the top tips that would help you to over keep a distance from malware. The tips would protect you from other malware programs too.

* Keep installed a robust security solution on your Android phone.
* Ensure that all your apps and the OS are updated with the latest version. An outdated app and OS carries loose ends and is vulnerable to malware attacks.
* Never click on any suspicious links from unknown emails and text messages.
* Avoid app downloads and installations from unknown sources. Only use the Google Play Store or other trusted sources. If you require an app outside of trusted sources, then scan it thoroughly before installation, and verify that it is secure.
* Avoid torrents and free download sites.
* Never use unprotected, opened public WiFi. If it is urgent, use a VPN along with that.
