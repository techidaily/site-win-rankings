There are a number of different types of Android malware, but the most common ones that you need to be aware of include spyware, ransomware, remote access Trojans (RATs), and adware.

Most people don’t realize that their phone is infected with a virus until it’s too late. Some of the most common symptoms of a virus infection on an Android phone include:

* **Slow Performance**: If your phone suddenly starts to run slowly or lag, this could be a sign that it has been infected with a virus.
* **Frequent Crashes and Freezes**: If your phone keeps freezing up or randomly crashing, this could be another indication of a virus infection.
* **Unusual Behavior**: You may notice that your phone is behaving in strange and unexpected ways. It may start to send text messages or make calls without your permission, it may install unfamiliar apps automatically, or it may change the look and feel of your phone’s user interface.
* **Battery Draining**: If your phone’s battery is draining quickly without reason, this could be a sign that it has been infected with a virus.

## How Can You Remove a Virus from an Android Phone Manually?
