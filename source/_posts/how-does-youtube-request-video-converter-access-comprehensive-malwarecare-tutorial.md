## Why YouTube is showing “Click to enable video converter”?

If you are regularly getting “Click to enable video converter” message on YouTube, then your system or browser is infected with a malicious program categorized as **[Adware](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/).**

Adware is the ad causing malware program that gets an entry on your system through infected bundled software, web apps, or web extensions.

Such programs are usually unintentionally installed on the victim’s system in the background, therefore often known as [Potentially Unwanted Applications](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)(PUAs). After entering into your system, other than generating irrelevant and malicious ads on the browser, Adware can also perform other dangerous activities like tracking user’s internet activities.

In this case, “Click to enable video converter” is an adware present on your browser in the form of web extension or add-on.

### **Step 1: Restart your PC in Safe Mode**
