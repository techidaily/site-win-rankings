## What are the causes of File Explorer Keep Opening?

Frankly, there is not a particular cause of this issue. However, the following are the possible reasons that can cause it.

* **A bug in the Windows** might have caused File Explorer to misbehave, and it is not getting the command correctly. This is usually the main cause of File Exploring popping.
* There might be some **Corrupted Files** present on your system that have caused this error in your display.
* There might be some **loose connections with your peripheral** that is misleading the Autoplay to launch the File Explorer randomly. A loose connection can lead Autoplay to re-launch some files or folders frequently, thereby, letting File Explorer open randomly. However, this would only happen if Autoplay is turned ON on your device.
* Another reason could be that your device got **infected with a malware** that is causing ‘File Explorer keep opening’ error on your system.

### **Remove the Autoplay**

If you came across ‘File Explorer keep opening’ problem when you try to connect an external hard disk or USB drive, then it may be because of Autoplay. The connection might be loose, and each time your external device is connected, the Autoplay opens up the File Explorer, creating this problem.

2\. Now change the default **View by** to Large icons or Small icons as per your preference.
